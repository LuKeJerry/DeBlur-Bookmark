# DeBlurBookmark
To remove blurring of images - for pixels lovers :-)


When looking at low resolution images, for example on retro forums like http://www.lemonamiga.com/, or https://www.lemon64.com/, http://hol.abime.net/, they are normally zoomed and blurred.

Saving this code as a bookmark and calling it while the page with blurred image is open, should remove the blurring effect leaving nice, simple, sharp pixels.

Works on Firefox and Chrome, tested with their latest release as of October 2019. Didn't test it on other browsers.

Not my idea, found it somewhere on the Twitter-sphere, but I can't find the source anymore to attribute credit :-/ 

Enjoy!
