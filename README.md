# DeBlurBookmark
To remove blurring of images - for pixels lovers :-)


When looking at low resolution images, especially on retro forums like http://www.lemonamiga.com/, or https://www.lemon64.com/, http://hol.abime.net/, they are zoomed and blurred.

Saving this code as bookmark and loading it while having the page with blurred image open, should remove the blurring effect showing nice, sharp, squared pixels.

Should work both on Firefox and Chrome. Tested on these ones with their latest release as of October 2019. Didn't test it on other browsers.

Not my idea, found it somewhere on the Twitter-sphere, but I can't find the source anymore to attribute credit :-/ 

Enjoy! (-;
